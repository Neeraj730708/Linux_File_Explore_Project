Project Overview:

In 2024, we developed a File Explorer application in C++ as a team of two. This lightweight application provides a simplified file management experience with a restricted feature set.

Features:

Normal Mode: Browse files and directories in the current directory using a simple navigation interface.

Command Mode: Execute basic shell commands for file operations efficiently.

Tech Stack: C++, File System Operations, Shell Commands

This project helped us strengthen our understanding of file system handling, command-line interactions, and C++ programming.
